# hello-world
My first repository
Hi there, Yvonne is the name. A current student at the Multimedia University of Kenya.
I love challenges and it really frustrates me when I i'm not able to counter them.


I am looking forward to joining Moringa School on the 4th of April.
Codewars is a little tricky to tackle, I won't lie I have been trying but it gets more difficult everytime.
As you might have already guessed, this was and is still my first github project.
I'm still trying to learn how to work with GIT though it's becoming a little tricky too.


Hi! so I actually gave up on codewars, its just frustrating!
But i'm loving html, css.. basically the front end.. its just beautiful!
Almost done with the African short stories website :)
