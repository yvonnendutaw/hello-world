# hello-world
My first repository
Hi there, Yvonne is the name. A current student at the Multimedia University of Kenya.
I love challenges and it really frustrates me when I i'm not able to counter them.
I am looking forward to joining Moringa School on the 4th of April.
Codewars is a little tricky to tackle, I won't lie I have been trying but it gets more difficult everytime.
